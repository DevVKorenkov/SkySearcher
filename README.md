A tool for recording inventory numbers in the Active Directory. At the moment, the prefixes of the inventory numbers and the attribute where the inventory number is recorded are tailored for a specific company. However, this is easy to change.

The program allows you to search for a computer or computers in the Asset Directory and record their inventory numbers, which makes it easier to keep track of when you have a large fleet of computers.

Condition for correct operation: the computer on which the application is launched must be a member of the domain.
The application itself determines which domain it is in.
